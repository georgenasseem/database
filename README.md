# Database-project
This is a small project I made when I was learning how to code in C#

I built this last year and I am hosting it now on github because I am learning git and github.

This project visualises how companies like facebook can store your personla data and steal them or send them to other people for money.
I have a info.txt which has all the important info to store inside. Ths file is hidden with my .gitignore because it has important data.
In this application you can either make an account or log into your own, after that you can add any info to your profile, al this info is secretly stored in the info.txt file
This file is easily accessable on my machine and I can see you data and username and password.
To run it I made a empty .info file in the repo, just download it, open your terminal and run the .csproj file there.
